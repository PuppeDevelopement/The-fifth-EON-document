# How to Cheat on EON
*ill update this more later*
This page will also contain reverse engineering done by me and a couple people on EON.

## Setup
STEP 1: put "GFSDK_Aftermath_Lib.x64.dll" in D:/PathToFortniteBuild + \Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\NVIDIA\NVaftermath\Win64 (IMPORTANT)
STEP 2: change config.ini to your fortnite path and email/pass
STEP 3: when fortnite launched it will output some json you have to make a auto reply rule in http debugger (how to do it is below)

Download https://www.httpdebugger.com/
Open it and click on "Auto Reply" at the top > Add Rule > 200 OK

should look like the screenshots below (what goes in content is what the launcher sends you)

then launch fortnite and you're good (if it doesnt work dont ask me for help)

and when a game goes up do "open ip:port" in console (F8 to open console)
